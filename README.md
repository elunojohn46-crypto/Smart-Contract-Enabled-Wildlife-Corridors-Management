# 🦌 Smart Contract-Enabled Wildlife Corridors Management

Welcome to a decentralized solution for managing wildlife corridors across borders! This Web3 project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to coordinate land use, ensure transparent monitoring, and facilitate international collaboration among stakeholders like governments, NGOs, landowners, and conservationists. It solves the real-world problem of fragmented wildlife habitat management, where cross-border coordination is often hindered by bureaucracy, lack of trust, and inefficient data sharing—leading to habitat loss and endangered species decline.

By leveraging blockchain, we create immutable records of land agreements, real-time monitoring data, and automated funding distribution, enabling seamless cooperation without centralized authorities.

## ✨ Features

🌍 Register and map wildlife corridors spanning multiple countries  
🤝 Multi-party land use agreements with automated enforcement  
📊 Submit and verify monitoring data (e.g., animal migrations, habitat health)  
💰 Transparent funding pools for corridor maintenance and incentives  
⚖️ Dispute resolution through on-chain voting and arbitration  
🔒 Immutable audit trails for compliance and reporting  
📈 Tokenized incentives for landowners participating in conservation  
🚧 Border-agnostic coordination via oracle-integrated external data

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Governments and NGOs (Corridor Planners)**  
- Propose a new wildlife corridor by registering land parcels and defining boundaries.  
- Invite stakeholders to sign multi-party agreements on land use restrictions (e.g., no development in key migration paths).  
- Use oracles to integrate real-world data like satellite imagery for corridor validation.  

**For Landowners**  
- Register your land parcel and opt-in to conservation agreements.  
- Receive tokenized rewards (e.g., NFTs or fungible tokens) for maintaining habitat.  
- Submit monitoring reports (e.g., wildlife sightings) to earn incentives from funding pools.  

**For Conservationists and Monitors**  
- Verify corridor status using on-chain data queries.  
- Submit verified data via oracles or direct contract calls to update habitat health metrics.  
- Participate in governance votes for corridor expansions or policy changes.  

**For Funders and Donors**  
- Contribute to funding pools tied to specific corridors.  
- Track fund usage transparently and trigger automated payouts based on milestones (e.g., successful animal migrations).  

That's it! All actions are recorded immutably, ensuring trust and accountability across borders.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

This project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts, each handling a specific aspect of corridor management for modularity and security:

1. **CorridorRegistry**: Registers new wildlife corridors, stores boundary data (e.g., geo-coordinates as strings), and links to participating land parcels. Prevents duplicates and allows queries for corridor details.  

2. **LandParcelNFT**: Manages NFTs representing individual land parcels. Handles minting, transferring ownership, and attaching metadata like usage restrictions or conservation status.  

3. **StakeholderRegistry**: Registers users (governments, NGOs, landowners) with roles and permissions. Uses principal-based authentication to control access to other contracts.  

4. **AgreementManager**: Facilitates multi-signature agreements for land use. Stakeholders sign on-chain; enforces rules like automated penalties for violations (e.g., via token burns).  

5. **MonitoringOracle**: Integrates external data feeds (e.g., from wildlife cameras or satellites) to submit and verify monitoring reports. Stores timestamps and hashes of data for immutability.  

6. **FundingPool**: Manages escrow-like pools for donations and grants. Automates distributions based on verified milestones, using token transfers.  

7. **DisputeResolver**: Handles disputes through on-chain voting among stakeholders. Resolves issues like agreement breaches with predefined arbitration logic.  

8. **GovernanceDAO**: Enables token holders to vote on corridor-wide decisions, such as expansions or rule changes. Uses a simple DAO model for decentralized control.  

These contracts interact seamlessly (e.g., AgreementManager calls StakeholderRegistry for validation), ensuring the system is scalable and upgradable while maintaining decentralization.
